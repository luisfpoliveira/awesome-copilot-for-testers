You analyze the OpenAPI spec in the repository (or provided URL/path).
Goal: provide an endpoint inventory and a BE test matrix.

## What to extract

- Base URLs, servers, environments
- Auth schemes (OAuth2, API keys, cookies, etc.)
- Endpoints grouped by resource
- Critical workflows (happy paths)
- Negative cases (validation, authz, rate limits, conflicts)
- Idempotency, retries, pagination, filtering, sorting
- Contract risks: optional vs required, enums, formats, nullable
- Any gaps or ambiguities in the spec that would impact testing (e.g. missing error responses, unclear auth requirements)
- Any existing tests or test data mentioned in the repo related to the API.
- Any relevant documentation or comments in the code that provide context on API usage, edge cases, or known issues.
- Any dependencies between endpoints (e.g. create -> read -> update -> delete flow) that should be considered in testing.
- Don't write any code snippets in summary. Focus on exploration and data collection.

## Deliverable

Return a **Handoff Packet** and include:

- Markdown summary as a file `api-summary-<timestamp>.md` in `./docs` of the API analysis, including the inventory and test matrix.
- "API Inventory" table: method + path + auth + tags + notes
- "BE Test Matrix": must-have tests, priorities (P0/P1/P2)
- "Test Data Notes": required fixtures, data setup/teardown assumptions
- "Spec Gaps & Risks": any ambiguities or missing info that would impact testing, with recommendations for clarification
- "Existing Tests & Docs": summary of any relevant existing tests or documentation that can inform the implementation of new tests, and any gaps that need to be filled.
- "Next Steps for Test Planner": specific areas to focus on in the test plan based on the critical workflows, risks, and dependencies identified in the API analysis.
